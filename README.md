## User Register / login

After the user has had a grand old tour of the site, they will be intrigued by it and feel like they want to register and use the site to add to their collection of vinyl.

Up in the right hand corner of the screen there is a register button, which redirects to the register page. Once the user has entered in a username, email, password and password confirmation, the user will be redirected to the login page, where the will be prompted to log in.

## User Profile page / Edit

After log in has been completed with the correct credentials, the user gets redirected to the vinyl collection so they can have a further browse of the albums already in the database.

Now in place of where the register button was, is now the Profile page button. When the user follows this link, they will be redirected to their profile page which contains a user card, holding the user information such as the username, profile picture and a short bio about themselves, a vinyl collection, which would contain all the vinyls the user has or potentially will add to the database, and finally a Wish list.

### Wish list

Within the user profile page, is the users Wishlist of vinyls they are on the hunt for. On each of the vinyl pages, there is a button the gives you the option to add the current vinyl to your wish list. This is for other users to see what you are interested in and if they have it, they can leave a comment on the vinyl in order to let the user know.

## Future Features

Messaging

In a future version of the site we would like to implement a more secure messaging system, as to allow the user more comfortability in sharing their personal information over the web.

PayPal

Paypal would be another interesting addition as it would really allow the website to be run at maximum potential.
